# Sign Shakti
A real-time automated interpreter for Indian/Pakistani Sign Language.

Created by Param Damle, Eli Kin, and Flavien Moise for HooHacks 2024.

_Shakti_ means "power" or "ability" in Hindi. With our solution, we hope to bridge gaps between communities regardless of communication style and community of origin, and empower learners of all walks of life to connect with the wider world through technology.

## Usage
Sign Shakti deploys in a React app. Clone this repository, and in the main folder run
